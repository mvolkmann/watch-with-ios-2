# watch-with-ios-2

This is a SwiftUI project that combines an iPhone and a watchOS app.
Each app displays a button that when tapped sends data to the other device.

The iPhone app sends a timestamp string to the watch which displays it.

The watchOS app sends:
- timestamp
- the watch battery percentage
- the watch battery state (unplugged, charging, full, or unknown)
- the watchOS version (ex. 9.0)
